**HEART DISEASE DIAGNOSIS**

_A predictive approach_

**Introduction:**

With the increasing environmental changes and rapid evolution, human bodies have become more prone and sensitive to deadly diseases than before. 
Being one of the most fatal conditions in the present world, cardiovascular disease refers to any disease that affects the cardiovascular system, including coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction or heart attack, stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), vascular diseases, and/or peripheral arterial diseases. 
One person dies every 33 seconds from a cardiac disease.
This increases the necessity to stop feigning ignorance and detect the disease to aid its diagnosis.

**Objective:**

1. The aim of this data science project focuses on determining the various health-related factors that are direct or indirect reasons for the increasing numbers of heart patients. 

2. By establishing relations between various attributes, the project also provides a model that serves to detect heart diseases, which in turn can reduce the number of cases by predicting them in their early stages
